",The U.S. Munitions List (USML) is a comprehensive designation of articles",services,and related technical data as defense articles or defense services under the Arms Export Control Act. It is organized into categories with alphanumeric paragraphs and subparagraphs,major systems,parts,components,accessories,and directly related technical data and defense services. Key aspects include the designation of 'Significant Military Equipment' (SME) for asterisk-preceded items and 'Missile Technology Control Regime' (MTCR) designation for items on the MTCR Annex.
